Alright everyone, I'm Flight Director Gene Kranz, nice to meet you. I've called you all here because we have an import mission. We are going to the moon, and you four are the tip of the spear. Things may go wrong, but here at Mission Control we will do everything in our power to make sure that doesn't happen. I will close with, good luck to everyone.
